Welcome to the *Pytorch course* created by [HDSP](http://hdspgroup.com/) Research Group! In this hands-on course, you will learn the basics of [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) a powerful framework for building and training neural networks.

The entire course content is condensed into a *single notebook*:

## the notebook

The course material is contained within a notebook - [classification_pytorch.ipynb](https://github.com/hdspgroup/pytorch-course/blob/main/classification_pytorch.ipynb). This notebook provides a hands-on walkthrough of PyTorch basics by stepping through the tasks of loading data, building and training a neural network model, and evaluating the results.

this material can be downloaded and run locally, or used directly on Google Colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hdspgroup/pytorch-course/blob/main/classification_pytorch.ipynb) 



## Contents

The sections in the notebook are divided as follows:

Modules| Description
--- |---
**1** | *Data structure in Pytorch: Tensors*
**2** | *Data Loading and Visualization: CIFAR10*
**3** | *Define a Convolutional Neural Network*
**4** | *Define a Loss function*
**5** | *Define a Optimizer*
**6** | *Train the network on the training data*
**7** | *Test the network on the test data*

Each section contains explanatory text, annotated code samples, and relevant images to provide an intuitive understanding
